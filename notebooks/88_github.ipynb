    "* Writing descriptions helps you navigate through different versions of your files - every version you save is available in your repo and you can go back as many steps as you want.\n",
    "* Explore Github - it's a great tool and can be used not only for coding 😉 You can, for example:\n",
    "    * collaborate on documents or projects and keep the files on github, synchronizing them on your computer (versioning and commits are a great plus);\n",
    "    * share files, texts, projects with wider public (or store them for private use);\n",
    "    * make a simple webpage for your project (even a one-pager can look impressive) - and no coding skills needed\n",
